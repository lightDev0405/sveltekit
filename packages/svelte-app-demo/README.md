# svelte-app-demo

Place to try out [@sveltejs/app](https://github.com/sveltejs/app). Very basic and incomplete, many things haven't yet been thought through.

To start the app in development mode do `npm dev`. To build, use `npm run build`. This will use whichever adapter is specified in `svelte.config.js`, which will also need to be installed (or linked).
